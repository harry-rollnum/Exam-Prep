CS604PC: MACHINE LEARNING LAB

Course Objective:
 The objective of this lab is to get an overview of the various machine learning techniques and
can demonstrate them using python.

Course Outcomes:
 Understand modern notions in predictive data analysis
 Select data, model selection, model complexity and identify the trends
 Understand a range of machine learning algorithms along with their strengths and
weaknesses
 Build predictive models from data and analyze their performance
